## Which systems behaved like you expected? Which ones surprised you? In which ones did your initial idea evolve into something different?
- The physical concept that behaved similar to my expectation was gravitational force. Observed from System 1 and System 3, the gravitational force allows the objects/entities to move in a downward direction. 
- The physical concept that behaved differently from my initial idea was the elasticity and its corresponding tension. Observed from System 2, the effect of elasticity based on the parameter's input (in this case, the mouse movement) was much stronger and exaggerated. 

## Describe your 1st system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?
- "PHYSICS IN CHRISTMAS"
- In this project, I used gravitational force to illustrate the falling snow as Christmas is approaching. (FYI, Winter is my favorite season!) The emergent behavior is the object "snow" which is emerging at the top of the image and falling in a wavy trajectory. The purpose of the wavy behavior of the object "snow" is to illustrate the horizontal wind force along with the vertical gravitational force. 

## Describe your 2nd system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?
- "SO SPRINGY PARTICLE"
- This project incorporates the following forces: Spring force, Elasticity, Tension, and Gravity. Specifically, the spring force, elasticity, and tension are the forces for the string's behaviors. The gravity acting upon the ball allows for the rope to eventually stabilize in a downward direction. The emergent behavior of the rope occurs when the user touches/moves/shakes the rope with the mouse input. 

## Describe your 3rd system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?
- "PLINKO"
- The forces entailed in this project are Collision, Elasticity, and Gravity. Collision and Elasticity can be observed when the colored balls collide with the white circles. When the balls collide with those circles, the elasticity of balls is illustrated through their bouncing off behaviors. The gravity is an underlying force system as all the balls are moving in a downward direction. 

## Describe your 4th system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?
- "FLOCKING" 
- In this project, I used boids simulation. The forces in this system are alignment, cohesion, and separation. Based on the input gui that user can adjust, the objects (random polar curves) behave correspondingly. The emerging behaviors of polar curves are based on the user-defined parameters in which the particles' motion affect one another. 

## Which system has one particle uses "particle-to-all-particles" forces (Boids style) or reads a map (Braitenberg-style). Explain how.
- System 4 "FLOCKING" uses "particle-to-all-particles" forces which I used boids simulation. Here, the forces that generate boids style effect are alignment, cohesion, and separation. Alignment parameter steer towards the average heading of local flockmates; Cohesion steers to move toward the average position of local flockmates; and Separation steers to avoid crowding local flockmates. (Reference for the definition and explanation of these effects: https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) 

## Which system has particles that leave a trail or creates new particles
- System 1, 3 and 4 leave a trail/create new particles. 
- System 1: Constant generation of snow particles from the top of the image. 
- System 3: Constant generation of colored balls from the top of the image. 
- System 4: Constant generation of random polar curves. 

## Which system interacts with user behavior, and how?
- System 2 and System 4 interact with the user behavior/input. 
- System 2: Based on the mouse movement of the user.
- System 4: Boids style system that allows to tune alignment, cohesion, and separation parameters with the GUI on the top right corner.
